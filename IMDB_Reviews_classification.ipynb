              "'jaws is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen the movie opens with blackness and only distant alienlike underwater sounds then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score dahdum from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie he works it like a theatrical production with a first act and a second act unlike so many modern filmmakers he has a great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act until then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music hes building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the sharks arrival is truly terrifying he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider a new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in twenty-five years the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money brody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss a young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark its a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror it is like ten movies all rolled into one and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven by star wars even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks psycho and it never seems to age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill the technical limitations faced by spielberg in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town its your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four gives a surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards bordering of parody shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism hes slightly deranged and shaws performance is almost a caricature however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u s s indianapolis a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over one zero other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film of course we cant leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are a threat every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark a bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into the shark in jaws was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was a sort of precursor to waterworld one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood'"

              "'every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio with every indication that it will be a stinker and to everybodys surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes a critical darling mav films election a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is a current example did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student elections tracy flick reese witherspoon is an overachiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high my i matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul a popularbutslow jock to run and pals nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be you cant help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have election a good film does not live up to its hype what makes election so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from rushmore released a few months earlier the similarities are staggering tracy flick election is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play max fischer rushmore is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play the most significant tension of election is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student the most significant tension of rushmore is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student tracy flick is from a single parent home which has contributed to her drive max fischer is from a single parent home which has contributed to his drive the male bumbling adult in election matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he even gets a bee sting the male bumbling adult in rushmore bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he gets several bee stings and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay rushmore and a novel election contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from a genre the high school geeks revenge movie that hadnt been fully formed yet even so the strengths of election rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as pals antisocial sister tammy broderick here is playing the my rooney role from ferris mueller and he seems to be having the most fun hes had since then witherspoon is a revelation its early in the year its a comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbells character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then youre won over one thing thats been bothering me since ive seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film i suppose that coming from mav films i should expect no less but the film starts off light and airy like a sitcom as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides to add elements that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that my i doesnt like tracks determination to win at all costs but did they have to throw in the studentteacher relationship even so theres no logical reason why my i has an affair when he does theres a lot to like in election but the plot similarities to rushmore and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sexdriven mark this as a disappointment'"
